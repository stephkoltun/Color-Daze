## A YEAR IN COLOR

- An experiment with colour and time
- Abstract/simplify the images to reveal patterns over time
- Less about the individual instants captured but what they reveal collectively over time
- How to display a large amount of data


- Time is easily sortable - linearly, multiple scales (day, month year, hour, etc)
- How can colour be sorted?
	- brightness
	- hue
	- saturation
- Can time be re-expressed in terms of prevalence
- Compress or stretch time based on how often it’s captured
- Represent each minute/hour/day/month/day of the week as a color
- meaningful associations between color and time


- The ability for individuals to analyze their own colour impressions


> What can be explored differently when displaying the information radially vs linearly



- as a point of comparison, see the “time as hex color” collectively


# PRECEDENTS
Jonathan Harris’ The Whale Hunt
- Retelling of a real-world experience on the internet
- Various lenses through which to explore the photographs (heartbeat, date/time, people, content/activity aka “concepts”, context/location

- No significant difference between the timeline and pinwheel visualization models. Chronological order, grouped by 20/30-minute segments
- Both highlight the changing pace of photography over the course of the trip

What Color Is It

http://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/
- time is turned into a hex value
12:35:16 = #123516
- why do these two different websites show different colors?
- always so dark; early in the day doesn’t mean bright colors
- two arbitrary values mapped onto each other
