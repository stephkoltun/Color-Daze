[Color Daze](http://anothersideproject.co/color-daze/index.html) reduces a single day to its color palette. Each image from the selected day is represented by its dominant color. When seen together, the color spectrum of the day is evident.


The site uses personal images from my travels and [Brian Gonzalez' RGBaster javascript library](https://github.com/briangonzalez/rgbaster.js/tree/master) to identify the dominant color.


This project was completed while taking a continuing education web design and development class at the Massachusettes College of Art and Design. Since then, I've learned a lot! My current work can be seen at: http://anothersideproject.co
